title: I'm Trying my Best

I am writing a post today to talk about how fun the MDS program is at UBC. It is hard, especially if you haven't taken any programming before. I would recommend taking Python before starting the program. I've really enjoyed learning about using statistics through programming versuses the pencil and paper or Excel as I've previously learned. 

 UBC is also so far away that the commute can be difficult (and the most hated part). 

All the best!
