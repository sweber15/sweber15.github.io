title: I'm Trying my Best

This is my attempt at DSCI 521. I am writing a post today to talk about how fun the MDS program is at UBC. It is definitely hard, especially if you haven't taken any programming before. I would recommend taking Python before starting the program. The other courses are okay, but you will learn something new everyday. UBC is also so far away that the commute can be difficult (and the most hated part). 

All the best!
